# """Performance Reviews
# At a particular company, employees are rated at the end of each year. The rating scale begins at 0.0, with higher
# values indicating better performance and resulting in larger raises. The value awarded to an employee is either
# 0.0, 0.4, or 0.6 or more. Values between 0.0 and 0.4, and between 0.4 and 0.6 are never used. The meaning associated
# with each rating is shown in the following table. The bonus awarded to an employee is $2400.00 multiplied by their
# rating.
#
# Rating Meaning
# 0.0 Unacceptable performance
# 0.4 Acceptable performance
# 0.6 or more Meritorious performance
#
# Write a program that reads a rating from the user and indicates whether the performance was unacceptable, acceptable
# or meritorious. The amount of the employeeâ€™s raise should also be reported. Your program should display an appropriate
# error message if an invalid number is entered."""
